# Optima iOS

Optima iOS is a reference application that implements the best practices of building iOS applications. 
The goal of this project is to incoporate the knowledge I gather from various blogs, articles and tutorials 
on how to build a good iOS application. I want to implement those learnings in a real life application and use it as a reference 
for my future self and for everyone else in the iOS community.

If you see any mistakes or have suggestions for improvement, please write up a github issue or submit a pull request.
